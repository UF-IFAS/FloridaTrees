For example, a 1-inch-diameter tree will be established 6 to 12 months after planting; a 2-inch-diameter tree will be established 12 to 24 months after planting.  Trees that are irrigated regularly are likely to establish quicker than those which receive only a minimum of irrigation.  In the northern part of the country, trees  establish at a slower rate than in the south."/>

<message soid="TREES HE IRRIGATION" text="* If trees will be irrigated only once or twice after planting, select "No irrigation after planting".  The program will recommend that only seedlings or small saplings of drought tolerant trees be planted if there is no irrigation.  * If trees will be irrigated regularly only until they are established (establishment requires about 6 -12 months per inch of trunk diameter measured 12 inches above the ground), select "Irrigation during establishment only".  In this case the program will recommend only drought tolerant trees be planted and nursery stock of any size can be selected.  * If irrigation can be supplied during establishment and during extended drought, then drought tolerant and moderately drought tolerant trees will be included on the recommended list of trees.  * If irrigation is installed or will be supplied regularly for the life of the tree, then all trees in the data base will be eligible for inclusion on the recommended list."/>

When you finish with the map, click the left button on the mouse and choose the appropriate zone."/>

<message soid="TREES HE SALTGROUND" text="Selecting "yes" will eliminate more than about 70% of the trees in the database because there are only a small number of trees with a known tolerance for high soil salt concentration."/>

<message soid="TREES HE SHCOV" text="Consider adding soil so there is at least 2 feet of final soil cover over the refuse or over the cap, if a cap is present.  Trees, shrubs and grasses grow poorly in cover soil less than 2 feet thick.  A greater variety of trees can be planted in deeper soil, and trees will be healthier than in shallow cover soil."/>

<message soid="TREES HE ZONEHELP" text="Each tree is tolerant of a certain low winter temperature.  If the winter temperature drops below this critical point, the tree will be damaged.  It is very important to select the correct USDA hardiness zone for your planting site.  If you are unsure of the hardiness zone at the planting site, choose "Do not know"."/>

<message soid="TREES HE WIREBIG" text="* If you "Select trees that will not interfere with the wires", then branches on the trees in your recommended tree list will not grow into the wires.  * If you "Select from a broader list knowing that some could grow into the wires", then some of the smaller twigs and branches on the larger trees in the recommended list may grow into the wires and require some trimming or pruning to keep them away from the wires.  However, major pruning will not be needed!  When the branches on these larger trees reach the wires, the utility company must prune or trim the tree to ensure continued service.  This costs utility companies (and ultimately the customers) about 2 billion dollars (1993 dollars) each year in the United States.  This cost could be lowered by planting only a properly sized tree near wires.  We recommend that you select trees that will not interfere with the wires."/>

<message soid="TREES HE PRUNE" text="Some trees, such as sycamore and Baldcypress and some cultivars, develop a dominant trunk and a strong branch structure with little or no pruning.  For these trees, one or two structural prunings during the first 12 years in the life of the tree are usually all that is needed to create a well structured tree.  Planting these type of trees could help to reduce your tree maintenance budget.  * Select "Yes" from the menu if you would like to plant only these trees.  A word of caution is in order: Only 50 percent of the trees in this data base have this characteristic.  Most large-maturing trees benefit from regular pruning in the first 15 to 25 years after planting to develop strong structure.  * Select "No" if you would like to include all of the trees in the database, regardless of their pruning requirements.  Please note that most trees need pruning during their life for a variety of reasons, and no tree should be considered completely maintenance free."/>

<message soid="TREES HE BREAK" text="Some trees, such as Boxelder, are reported to be susceptible to breakage in storms.  These trees may have weaker wood than other trees or be more prone to developing bark inclusions in branch crotches (especially if they are not properly pruned).  * Select "Yes" from the menu if you want to exclude these trees from your recommended tree list.  This will eliminate (during this tree selection session only) 20 percent of the trees in the database from the list of recommended trees.  * Select "No" if this does not concern you.  Selecting "No" will give you the longest tree list."/>

<message soid="TREES HE WIRE" text="This question refers to the horizontal distance between the planting hole and the wire.  You may be asked about the distance between the ground and the wire in the next question.  Unfortunately, trees are often planted too close to wires.  When the branches reach the wires, the utility company must prune or trim the tree to ensure continued service.  This costs utility companies (and ultimately the customers) more than about 2 billion dollars (2005 dollars) each year in the United States.  This cost could be lowered by planting only a properly sized tree near wires.  It is best to plant trees as far away from wires as possible.  Planting farther from the wire will increase the size of the recommended tree list."/>

<message soid="TREES HE DROOP" text="Branches on many trees, such as many of the oaks, droop toward the ground as they grow older and they will need to be removed periodically to allow vehicles or pedestrians to pass beneath.  The pruning requirements on your trees can be reduced by selecting trees without drooping branches, such as the upright cultivars of a variety of trees.  * If you want to exclude trees with drooping branches, select "Yes" from the menu.  A word of caution is in order: Forty-four percent of the trees in the data base have drooping branches, and if you select "Yes" they will be eliminated (during this tree selection session only) from the list of recommended trees.  Your list of recommended trees may be short."/>

<message soid="TREES HE BUILDFAR" text="* If you select "A small or medium sized tree" or "Any tree with a crown diameter less than 50 feet" then branches on the trees in the recommended tree list will not touch the building.  * If you select "A tree of any size" then be sure you are prepared to train and prune the large trees in the recommended tree list so the major branches clear the building.  Be sure that the branches which are trained to grow over the building are well attached to the tree."/>

<message soid="TREES HE PH" text="Soil pH should be determined before selecting trees for planting.  A number of trees grow poorly in soil with a pH less than 4.2 or greater than 8.2.  If you indicate that the pH is between 4.2 and 7.5, then all trees in this database will be eligible for inclusion in the recommended tree list.  If you indicate that the pH is greater than 7.5, only trees tolerant of alkaline soil will be included on the list.  * Collect a combined soil sample from five or more 12-inch-deep holes at the planting site.  If the planting site is large or the soil is variable throughout the site, several separate samples are recommended.  Mix the soil together from the five or more holes and have it analyzed by a soil testing laboratory.  Some local County Cooperative Extension Service offices can perform the analysis or they can direct you to a commercial laboratory."/>

<message soid="TREES HE SIDEWALK" text="Plant far away from the walk to minimize future damage to the sidewalk from tree roots.  * Only small trees will be recommended for planting 2 to 4 feet from the walk.  * Small and medium maturing trees will be recommended for planting 4 to 6 feet from the walk.  * Small, medium and large trees will be recommended for planting 6 to 8 feet away.  * Trees of any size (including very large ones like sycamore) will be eligible for inclusion on the list if you are planting more than 8 feet from the walk or curb.  * If you indicate that you are planting within 8 feet of the sidewalk, the recommended tree list will not include trees which are known to have large, invasive root systems which would be likely to raise the sidewalk.  * If past experience in your community shows that medium and large maturing trees can be planted closer than suggested in these guidelines, choose "More than 8 feet away" from the menu.  This will provide you with a list of trees of all sizes, but remember that walks may be damaged if you plant medium and large trees too close."/>

<message soid="TREES HE DRAIN" text="To evaluate water drainage, dig several holes 18 inches deep in several areas on the site and fill each one with water.  * If water drains completely away within one hour, select "Fast" from the menu.  * If water is still in the hole after one hour but drains completely away within one day, select "Moderate" from the menu.  * If water takes longer than one day to drain away, select "Slowly" from the menu.  * If water stands for long periods after it rains, select "water stands for long periods" - most trees will be eliminated from the list of recommended trees by selecting this route.  * Soil drainage characteristics must be carefully evaluated at the planting site.  Many tree species do not grow well in poorly drained, wet soil.  If you can improve the drainage on a poorly drained site by modifying the site, you will be able to select from a much wider variety of trees."/>

<message soid="TREES HE MEDPK" text="* Small and medium maturing trees are probably best suited for this site, but some large maturing trees, such as oaks, may grow fine for a period of time.  Trees planted in this poorly-drained, compacted soil will be shallow rooted.  The root system is often confined to the parking lot island and they are not likely to grow beneath the pavement in this type soil.  * Large trees are not well suited for this island due to the chance of wind-throw and future curb damage from roots growing along the curb.  Large-maturing trees are not likely to reach their mature size, and they will be under more stress than smaller maturing trees in this size island.  This will increase the maintenance requirements on large trees."/>

<message soid="TREES HE MEDTREE" text="If you select "A small or medium-sized tree", the list of recommended trees will contain small and medium maturing trees which will not grow tall enough to reach the wires.  * If you select "Any tree with a narrow spread", only trees with a crown diameter of less than 35 feet will be included in the recommended tree list.  The tips of branches on some of the larger trees in the recommended list may reach the wires as the trees reach maturity."/>

<message soid="TREES MS VERYLOW" text="If you are not restricted by your earlier choices, you may plant a medium or large maturing tree here but it will have to be trained and pruned to grow over the wire so the branches will not touch the wire.

<message soid="TREES HE LIGHT" text="The following helps you decide if the site has reflected light.  Sunlight reflected from a glass covered building, a building with most of the side covered in glass or a white wall increases the heat load on a tree planted near a building.  Even though the site may receive only 2 to 5 hours of direct sun, the plant must tolerate a high heat load during that time due to the reflected light.  To account for this, only drought tolerant trees which tolerate full sun will be selected for this site.  Be sure that there is a large area of soil for roots to explore since this often helps trees withstand reflected light."/>
