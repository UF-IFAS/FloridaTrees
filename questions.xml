<QUESTION soid="TREES cutout fruit">
	<TITLE>After considering this, would you like to eliminate trees with messy fruit?</TITLE>
	<HELP>Messy trees are those which stain cars or sidewalks (such as Black Olive), drop slimy (such as Mulberry) or large fruit (such as Hickory), twigs or branches (such as Mango) on a regular basis, or those that drop leaves over a long period of time (such as Sycamore).  This usually is of most concern when planting in parking lots or along streets, sidewalks or hard-surfaced recreation areas.  * If you select "Yes" from the menu, 30 percent of the trees in the data base will be eliminated from the list of recommended trees because they have been rated as messy.  * If you pick "No" from the menu, you will get more trees on the recommended tree list.  You can then read the descriptive information about the tree when you are finished with this tree selection session to determine which trees may not be suited for your site due to messy habit.</HELP>

	<HELP>If the tree will be maintained as an espalier, it can be planted within 5 feet of the building.  * If you select "Yes" from the menu, then only trees suited for espalier training will be included in the list of recommended trees.  Espaliers require regular pruning to keep the plant flat against the wall.  * If you select "No", then you will be asked if you would like to plant farther from the building since trees not maintained as espaliers should not be planted within 5 feet of a building.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES grow near wires">
	<TITLE>Would you like to:</TITLE>
	<HELP>* If you "Select trees that will not interfere with the wires", then branches on the trees in your recommended tree list will not grow into the wires.  * If you "Select from a broader list knowing that some could grow into the wires", then some of the smaller twigs and branches on the larger trees in the recommended list may grow into the wires and require some trimming or pruning to keep them away from the wires.  However, major pruning will not be needed!  When the branches on these larger trees reach the wires, the utility company must prune or trim the tree to ensure continued service.  This costs utility companies (and ultimately the customers) about 2 billion dollars (1993 dollars) each year in the United States.  This cost could be lowered by planting only a properly sized tree near wires.  We recommend that you select trees that will not interfere with the wires.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES overhead lines">
	<TITLE>How close (horizontally) is the planting hole to the nearest wire?</TITLE>
	<HELP>This question refers to the horizontal distance between the planting hole and the wire.  You may be asked about the distance between the ground and the wire in the next question.  Unfortunately, trees are often planted too close to wires.  When the branches reach the wires, the utility company must prune or trim the tree to ensure continued service.  This costs utility companies (and ultimately the customers) more than about 2 billion dollars (2005 dollars) each year in the United States.  This cost could be lowered by planting only a properly sized tree near wires.  It is best to plant trees as far away from wires as possible.  Planting farther from the wire will increase the size of the recommended tree list.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES tree lawn width">
	<TITLE>What is the width of the tree lawn (streetscape or parkway)?</TITLE>
	<HELP>The treelawn is the soil or grassy strip between the curb and the sidewalk.  Small and medium maturing trees can be planted in 3 to 4 foot wide treelawns.  Large trees planted in small treelawns often raise sidewalks and displace curbs.  They are considered too big for this small space.  Repairing the sidewalk and curb can be costly and can severely damage the tree.  Larger trees can be planted in wider treelawns.  Trees with thorns on the trunk or branches will not be included in the list of recommended trees if you are planting in a treelawn.  After this program generates the recommended tree list, consider deleting trees from the list that have invasive root systems that would be more likely to damage walks than trees without these roots.  You will be able to do this after the first tree list is generated in a few minutes.</HELP>

	<HELP>The following helps you decide if the site has reflected light.  Sunlight reflected from a glass covered building, a building with most of the side covered in glass or a white wall increases the heat load on a tree planted near a building.  Even though the site may receive only 2 to 5 hours of direct sun, the plant must tolerate a high heat load during that time due to the reflected light.  To account for this, only drought tolerant trees which tolerate full sun will be selected for this site.

	<HELP>The loose, well-drained soil which you indicated is present at this site is rare in parking lot islands.  You may want to reevaluate the water drainage and soil compaction at the planting site!  The loose, well-drained soil at this site will allow some roots to grow down and anchor the trees.  * Small and medium maturing trees are probably best suited for this size island, but some large maturing trees should grow fine for a period of time.  * If large maturing trees grow well in the island, they will create shade but surface roots could cause curb and pavement damage as the roots grow next to and beneath the curb.  Curbs and/or pavement may need to be replaced in order to make the area safe for pedestrians.  Tree roots are often severely damaged during curb replacement.  Small and medium maturing trees will not usually cause this type of damage, but they will not provide the shade that larger trees do.  The best alternative is to increase the size of the island.

	<HELP>Refuse with organic material such as that from homes and restaurants contains biodegradable garbage.  Select this if the planting will be done on the top or sides of this type landfill.  * Non-biodegradable landfills contain only bricks, concrete, appliances and other products which do not decompose.  Select this if the planting will be done on the top or sides of this type landfill.  * If the planting site is next to (but not on) a landfill containing biodegradable refuse, landfill gas could migrate from the refuse into the soil around the landfill.  This could have an adverse impact on plant growth.  This is usually not as great a problem as growing trees on the top and sides of the landfill.  Select this if the planting will be near but not on the landfill.  * A mine or other severe site could be an old strip mine or other disturbed soil area where subsoil has been mixed with or moved to the surface.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES vandalism question">
	<TITLE>Are the trees likely to be vandalized at the site?</TITLE>
	<HELP>People sometimes intentionally destroy or injure trees after they are planted.  Trees may be unintentionally injured in downtown planting sites such as in a tree pit where many people regularly walk close to the tree.  * If you are planting in an area where trees may be vandalized or injured, select "Yes" in the menu.  The program will eliminate trees which have thin bark, such as Red Maple, from the list of recommended trees.  In addition, the report which is printed at the end of this tree selection session will indicate that it is best to purchase trees which are at least 1.5 to 2 inches in caliper since trees of this size appear to perform better than smaller trees in areas where vandalism is a problem.  * If vandalism is not a problem, or if it is a problem but you choose to ignore this advice, select "No" from the menu.  This will ensure that thin-barked trees are not eliminated from the recommended tree list.</HELP>

	<TITLE>Would you like trees with drooping branches excluded from the list of recommended trees?</TITLE>
	<HELP>Branches on many trees, such as many of the oaks, droop toward the ground as they grow older and they will need to be removed periodically to allow vehicles or pedestrians to pass beneath.  The pruning requirements on your trees can be reduced by selecting trees without drooping branches, such as the upright cultivars of a variety of trees.  * If you want to exclude trees with drooping branches, select "Yes" from the menu.  A word of caution is in order: Forty-four percent of the trees in the data base have drooping branches, and if you select "Yes" they will be eliminated (during this tree selection session only) from the list of recommended trees.  Your list of recommended trees may be short.</HELP>

	<HELP>When gas is actively pumped from the refuse, the cover soil remains oxygenated because little or no methane or carbon dioxide will migrate into the cover soil.

<QUESTION soid="TREES question 6">
	<TITLE>Would you like to exclude trees which require regular pruning when young?</TITLE>
	<HELP>Some trees, such as sycamore and Baldcypress and some cultivars, develop a dominant trunk and a strong branch structure with little or no pruning.  For these trees, one or two structural prunings during the first 12 years in the life of the tree are usually all that is needed to create a well structured tree.  Planting these type of trees could help to reduce your tree maintenance budget.  * Select "Yes" from the menu if you would like to plant only these trees.  A word of caution is in order: Only 50 percent of the trees in this data base have this characteristic.  Most large-maturing trees benefit from regular pruning in the first 15 to 25 years after planting to develop strong structure.  * Select "No" if you would like to include all of the trees in the database, regardless of their pruning requirements.

<QUESTION soid="TREES question 1">
	<TITLE>Would you like trees which are messy excluded from your list of trees?</TITLE>
	<HELP>Messy trees are those which stain cars or sidewalks (such as Black Olive), drop slimy (such as Mulberry) or large fruit (such as Hickory), twigs or branches (such as Mango) on a regular basis, or those that drop leaves over a long period of time (such as Sycamore).  This usually is of most concern when planting in parking lots or along streets, sidewalks or hard-surfaced recreation areas.  * If you select "Yes" from the menu, 30 percent of the trees in the data base will be eliminated from the list of recommended trees because they have been rated as messy.  * If you pick "No" from the menu, you will get more trees on the recommended tree list.  You can then read the descriptive information about the tree when you are finished with this tree selection session to determine which trees may not be suited for your site due to messy habit.</HELP>

Although small and medium maturing trees are best suited for this site, some large maturing trees may grow fine for a period of time.

	<HELP>* Clay soil is composed of very small particles and it smears in your hand when it is wet.  * Loam soil may or may not smear and there may be some sand particles evident.  * Sandy soil has a distinctive sand feel and is gritty.  * If bedrock comes close to the surface leaving only a thin layer of soil on top, select "There is little soil" from the menu.  If there is little soil, consider planting only small or medium-maturing trees to help prevent large surface roots from forming.  If you choose to plant large maturing trees on a site with little soil, select those with non-invasive roots.  You will be able to make this choice later in the program.  * If the soil is mixed with construction-type debris, select from the menu the texture which most closely matches the soil component of the mixture.  Consider replacing the soil if there are bricks, concrete or other construction debris mixed with the soil.

<QUESTION soid="TREES question 3">
	<TITLE>Are there overhead wires within 30 feet of the planting site?</TITLE>
	<HELP>This question refers to the horizontal distance between the planting hole and the wire.  You may be asked about the distance between the ground and the wire in the next question.  Unfortunately, trees are often planted too close to wires.  When the branches reach the wires, the utility company must prune or trim the tree to ensure continued service.  This costs utility companies (and ultimately the customers) more than about 2 billion dollars (2005 dollars) each year in the United States.  This cost could be lowered by planting only a properly sized tree near wires.  It is best to plant trees as far away from wires as possible.  Planting farther from the wire will increase the size of the recommended tree list.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES wdexwd200">
	<TITLE>Would you like to choose:</TITLE>
	<HELP>The loose, well-drained soil which you indicated is present at this site is rare in parking lot islands.  You may want to reevaluate the water drainage and soil compaction at the planting site!  If soil is loose and well-drained, some roots will grow down and anchor the trees.  * Although small and medium maturing trees are probably best suited for this size island, most large maturing trees should grow fine for a period of time.  * Large-maturing trees, such as oaks, are not likely to reach their mature size, and they will be under stress in this small island.  This will increase the maintenance requirements on large trees.  If medium and large maturing trees grow well in the island, they will create shade but surface roots could cause curb and pavement damage as the roots grow next to and beneath the curb.  Curbs and/or pavement may need to be replaced in order to make the area safe for pedestrians.  Tree roots are often severely damaged when the curb is replaced.  Small trees will not usually cause this type of damage, but they will not provide the shade that larger trees do.  The best alternative is to increase the size of the island.  If you can do this, quit the program now by pressing the right button on the mouse and start over, indicating a larger island size.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES water table">
	<TITLE>The water table is:</TITLE>
	<HELP>Dig several holes on the site about 2 feet deep and wait 2 or 3 hours.  * If there is no water in the hole, or the distance between the top of the water and the soil surface is greater than 18 inches, then select "More than 18 inches below the soil surface".  If this is the case, all trees in the database will be eligible for inclusion on the recommended tree list.  * If water fills the hole, measure the distance between the soil surface and the top of the water after 2 to 3 hours.  If this distance is less than 18 inches, select "Within 18 inches of the soil surface" from the menu.  Only trees that are tolerant of wet sites will be included on the list of recommended trees if the water table is within 18 inches of the surface.</HELP>

<QUESTION soid="TREES water drainage">
	<TITLE>How fast does water drain through the soil?</TITLE>
	<HELP>To evaluate water drainage, dig several holes 18 inches deep in several areas on the site and fill each one with water.  * If water drains completely away within one hour, select "Fast" from the menu.  * If water is still in the hole after one hour but drains completely away within one day, select "Moderate" from the menu.  * If water takes longer than one day to drain away, select "Slowly" from the menu.  * If water stands for long periods after it rains, select "water stands for long periods" - most trees will be eliminated from the list of recommended trees by selecting this route.  * Soil drainage characteristics must be carefully evaluated at the planting site.  Many tree species do not grow well in poorly drained, wet soil.  If you can improve the drainage on a poorly drained site by modifying the site, you will be able to select from a much wider variety of trees.</HELP>
