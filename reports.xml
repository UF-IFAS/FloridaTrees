Always plant in the center of the island at the widest part to allow for root and trunk expansion.  Small trees should be planted at least 2 feet from the edge of the island, medium-sized trees should be at least 4 feet away and large maturing trees should be 8 feet from the edge of the island, if possible.  This guideline will help maintain the integrity of the curb around the island and help the tree anchor into the island.

This is a very droughty site and regular or periodic irrigation is recommended.  Since you indicated that gas will not be pumped from the refuse, some landfill gas may seep through the cracks in the landfill cap and displace oxygen from the root zone in certain spots.

You indicated that gas will be pumped from the refuse.  As long as gas is actively pumped from the refuse, landfill gas should not enter the soil cover.  If the gas recovery system is turned off, even for a short period, landfill gas could enter the soil cover and cause poor growth or plant mortality.

Damage caused by high wind speed and frequent lightning strikes can limit tree establishment and growth.  Consider planting only trees with an open or moderately dense canopy which mature at a small or medium size to minimize this problem.  Small saplings and seedlings appear to survive and establish faster than larger trees.  Research suggests that this is related to the ability of the root system on small trees to better adapt to the landfill conditions.  If large, landscape-sized planting stock is installed, it may require staking to prevent the wind from blowing the tree over."/>

Only plant seeds, seedlings or small saplings less than one inch in trunk diameter so the root system has a chance to adapt to the thin, gas contaminated soil.  Larger, landscape-sized trees will have difficulty establishing a good root system.  Expect some tree mortality, perhaps over large areas, from displacement of oxygen from the root zone by methane and carbon dioxide.

Whether the soil is replaced or not, the soil drainage and soil density at this site are likely to confine roots to the soil within the island, therefore only small trees are recommended.

Installation and maintenance costs are higher for trees planted in this setting.  Be sure that the soil drainage and soil compaction tests were conducted carefully since poor drainage in compacted soil often kills trees in a sidewalk cutout.  Consider installing a water drainage system before planting if water drains slowly from the planting area.  Consider installing an aeration system to provide oxygen to the roots. Special soil and design techniques can improve tree performance dramatically and these should be considered (visit http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/woody for details).  In sandy, well drained soil, trees often become stressed from too little water unless they are properly irrigated.  If you have the option, plant in an area with more open soil.  The minimum cutout size is 4' X 4 feet.  

Trees in this list are tolerant of drought, usually grow to at least 15 feet tall, and do not have thorns on the trunk or branches.  Several trees that mature at less than 15 feet tall could be on the list, but they are not recommended for planting because the branches cannot be pruned up enough to provide clearance for pedestrians.
